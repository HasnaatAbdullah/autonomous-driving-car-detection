# autonomous-driving-car-detection
Implemented a car detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection. Includes bounding box predictions, non-max suppression, intersection over union, and testing on real road images.
# ðŸš— Autonomous Driving - Car Detection using YOLO

This project implements a **car detection system** using the **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** object detection model.  
The system processes road images, detects cars, and draws bounding boxes around them in real time.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Autonomous driving requires **real-time object detection** to ensure safety.  
This project focuses on using **YOLO**, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect cars in images captured by a **front-mounted camera**.

**Key Features:**
- Implemented **YOLO** for car detection.
- Used **pre-trained YOLO weights** for efficiency.
- Calculated **Intersection over Union (IoU)** for bounding box evaluation.
- Applied **Non-Max Suppression (NMS)** to remove duplicate detections.
- Visualized bounding boxes on road images.
